        Writing down the password to a password manager and storing it in a
        secure location is common advice. This takes that advice in a{' '}
        <em>weird</em> üëΩ and <strong>wonderful</strong> ü™Ñ direction by
        generating a page (with the intent of being printed out and stored
        securely) of barcodes that ‚Äúencode‚Äù secrets (the encoding is not a true
        security measure).
      </p>
      <p className="no-print">
        In this way, no human-readable passwords are stored. As a bonus, the
        printed barcode can be used as an easy, error-free way to enter
        passwords that serves as an alternative to biometrics. Perfect for older
        systems.

        Good instinct! You can inspect the source and network tab to validate
        that all secret logic takes place purely in the browser, but the choice
        is yours!
