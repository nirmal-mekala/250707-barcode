          Writing down the password to a password manager and storing it in a
          secure location is common advice. This takes that advice in a{" "}
          <em>weird</em> üëΩ and <strong>wonderful</strong> ü™Ñ direction by
          generating a page (with the intent of being printed out and stored
          securely) of barcodes that ‚Äúencode‚Äù secrets (the encoding is not a
          true security measure).
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, no human-readable passwords are stored. As a bonus, the
          printed barcode can be used as an easy, error-free way to enter
          passwords that serves as an alternative to biometrics. Perfect for
          older systems.

          Good instinct! You can inspect the source and network tab to validate
          that all secret logic takes place purely in the browser, but the
          choice is yours!
