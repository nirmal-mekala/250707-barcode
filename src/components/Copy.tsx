        ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND ALWAYS STORE PASSWORDS IN A

      <h2>wtf</h2>
      <p>
        Writing down the password to a password manager and storing it in a
        secure location is common advice. This takes that advice in a{' '}
        <em>weird</em> üëΩ and <strong>wonderful</strong> ü™Ñ direction by
        generating a page (with the intent of being printed out and stored
        securely) of barcodes that ‚Äúencode‚Äù secrets (the encoding is not a true
        security measure).
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, no human-readable passwords are stored. As a bonus, the
        printed barcode can be used as an easy, error-free way to enter
        passwords that serves as an alternative to biometrics. Perfect for older
        systems.
      </p>
      <h2>no way i‚Äôm entering my password</h2>
      <p>
        Good instinct! You can inspect the source and network tab to validate
        that all secret logic takes place purely in the browser, but the choice
        is yours!
